       <!-- <h2>Dear Suhaina,</h2>
        <h3>
            It's good to know that there are still a few good people left in this world. 
            Whenever I talked to you that I haven't talked to in a while, and it felt good to hear from you. 
            Thanks for being such a great friend, and for being there for me. 
            Friends like you are hard to find. 
            I thank God for Wisdom and Knowledge and to know the difference between real friends and fake ones. 
            Just when you began to trust someone they turn around and hurt you, but it's OK, 
            because I look at them like the devil. He may knock me down, but he didn't knock me out, 
            so therefore I can still stand and move forward. <br> <br>

            If I had the choice to <i><u><b>choose you again as a friend I would</b></u></i>. 
            Thank you for allowing my spirit to be free. 
            <i><b>You always told me that I can do anything as long as I am happy</b></i>. 
            By following your humble advice, I am presently happy and at peace with myself. 
            We are and always will be part of the same exploding star that burst millions of centuries ago. <br> <br>

            <center>
            <b>
                â€œSweet is the memory of distant friends! <br>
                Like the mellow rays of the departing sun, <br>
                it falls tenderly, yet sadly, on the heart."<br>
